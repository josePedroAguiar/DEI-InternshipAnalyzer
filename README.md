# DEI-Internship Analyzer

## Project Description
The DEI-Internship Analyzer is a platform created to assist masterâ€™s students in selecting internships that align with their career goals and values. By leveraging reviews from previous interns, the platform provides insights into work environments, mentorship quality, learning opportunities, and especially diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices. Users can search, filter, and view data visualizations of internship experiences, helping them make informed decisions.

**Note:** This project is currently in its early stages and is being developed with Django for both the frontend and backend. The initial intention was to build the frontend with React, which may still be integrated in future updates. However, this project may not be actively maintained, so feel free to clone, contribute, or suggest improvements. Your contributions are welcome!

## Features
- **Review Submission**: Collects detailed and anonymous reviews from past interns.
- **Search and Filter**: Allows users to search for internships by company, year, DEI ratings, and more.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays trends and scores across internships.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggests internships based on user preferences and DEI priorities.
